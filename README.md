# Squall of spells
The main idea is game controlled by "sigils" - a schematic symbols, drawn by player. Each of those has the corresponding spell to cast.
The spell system is ideologically similar to Magic: majority of the sigils are immediately available to the player, but there is neither a list of possible sigil draws nor a list of spells that sigiles cast. The player explores possible combinations in the process. And player improves their own skills rather than improves game character.
